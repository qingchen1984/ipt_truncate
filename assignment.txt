Kernel Module Spec
===================
- Target Module based on ipt_REJECT.c
- TRUNC
- options:
    > --at-byte (number of bytes from after ip header to keep)
        * Need to recompute checksums for ip and whatever other
            protocols are in there (either UDP or TCP)
        * There will be a number of the protocol in the IP header
- Packet is presumed to be IP
- Recompute checksum of IP (might do it after I am done w/ rest of packet)
- If packet is TCP or UDP, and the header of TCP and IP are fully included
    > If it is not TCP or UDP, do not fix payload
    > Fix IP regardless
- Truncate the optional TCP options in TCP header, adjust offset to 20 bytes
  and start truncated data from right after 20 bytes
- Start counting after IP header (if not TCP or UDP), after TCP/UDP header if it
  is either of those protocols
